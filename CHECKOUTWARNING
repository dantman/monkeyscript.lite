A short warning to people who checkout branches other than the master branch.
I will periodically rebase my branches onto the master to keep a clean history.
This means for all branches other than master I will be using --force on my
git push. I provide those branches as public reference to what I am working on.
They are essencially MY personal branches, I treat them as if they were on my
local computer. Thus if you wish to actually check these branches out, you'd
better be prepared to use --force on your git pull's from them. ~ Daniel Driesen
