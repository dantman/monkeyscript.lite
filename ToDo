- Support optimization (compilation of .js files to .js.class) (optimizer branch)
- Compile internal .js resources to java .class files on build

 - detection of UTF-8 and UTF-16 BOMs done
- Support a multi-reader to exec multiple scripts as if they were one?
- Banana

- Implement cli.shell.javascript (cli.shell.repl?) banana based on Rhino's shell
- Support doctest from within MonkeyScript
- Write Jake task system
- Bring io to a usable state
- Migrate Jake to use the working io banana
- Clean up the Buffer classes and either merge them into one or move generic stuff into Buffer itself
